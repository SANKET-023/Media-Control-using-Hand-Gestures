Project Title: Gesture-Controlled Media Interface ðŸŽ®âœ‹

Description:
Revolutionize media control with hand gestures! Our project offers an intuitive, gesture-driven interface for managing media playback and volume, replacing traditional remotes.

Use Cases:
1. Gaming Console Replacement: Elevate gaming experiences by seamlessly controlling media with gestures.
2. Accessibility Enhancement: Empower individuals with disabilities with an alternative, gesture-based interface.

Note: Please note that "Project_1.py" and "Project_2.py" are two separate projects, each using different sets of hand gestures for distinct actions. Review their documentation for specific gesture mappings. #GestureControl #MediaPlayback #Accessibility #OpenSource
